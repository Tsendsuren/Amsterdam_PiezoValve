# Amsterdam_PiezoValve
The Amsterdam Piezo Valve is one of the best valves (through my own experience) for intense pulsed atomic and molecular beams. For the convenience of experimenting with this piezo valve, I made a LABVIEW program for remote control.

## Instructions
The Piezo valve control LabVIEW program is made for LabVIEW 2016, 32-bit version. Therefore, LabVIEW 2016 or a later version is recommended. To use the code, simply connect the controller to the PC with a USB cable and find the appropriate COM port, then indicate it in the code.
